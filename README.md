basketballTournamentSimulator

# What it does

Once you provide the simulator team names and stats, a King of the Hill tournament will be simulated. The winner will be output alongside the stats behind the tournament (final scores, blocks on each side, etc).

# How to use it

You will be prompted for the basketball stats of your team (shooting %, seed number, team name, and if they are cursed or not (like the Sacramento Kings)). After following the console prompts, the tournament will begin. 

The tournament is King of the Court style. Meaning, the winner will continue to play the next challenger. If the current winner (King) loses, then the new winner becomes the King and faces off against the next, fresh team (think back to elementary school tennis). To keep things all fair and square, there is no fatigue factor so the King is not disadvantaged :)

This simulator does not have teams hard-coded, so you can simulate NBA, NCAA or even NBA + NCAA mashup tournaments.

**NCAA**: Arizona State Sun Devils (don't have a choice here), but I like Michigan and Michigan State too.

**NBA**: LA Lakers until Lonzo leaves
